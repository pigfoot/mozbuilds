<h2><a name="_commands"></a>COMMANDS</h2>
<a name="add"></a><dl>
<dt>
add[OPTION]&#8230; [FILE]&#8230;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the repository.
</p>
<pre>The files will be added to the repository at the next commit. To
undo an add before that, see hg revert.</pre>
<pre>If no names are given, add all files to the repository.</pre>
<pre>options:
-I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns
-n, --dry-run  do not perform actions, just print output</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="addremove"></a><dl>
<dt>
addremove[OPTION]&#8230; [FILE]&#8230;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Add all new files and remove all missing files from the repository.
</p>
<pre>New files are ignored if they match any of the patterns in .hgignore. As
with add, these changes take effect at the next commit.</pre>
<pre>Use the -s option to detect renamed files. With a parameter &gt; 0,
this compares every removed file with every added file and records
those similar enough as renames. This option takes a percentage
between 0 (disabled) and 100 (files must be identical) as its
parameter. Detecting renamed files this way can be expensive.</pre>
<pre>options:
-s, --similarity  guess renamed files by similarity (0&lt;=s&lt;=100)
-I, --include     include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude     exclude names matching the given patterns
-n, --dry-run     do not perform actions, just print output</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="annotate"></a><dl>
<dt>
annotate[-r REV] [-f] [-a] [-u] [-d] [-n] [-c] [-l] FILE&#8230;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    List changes in files, showing the revision id responsible for each line
</p>
<pre>This command is useful to discover who did a change or when a change took
place.</pre>
<pre>Without the -a option, annotate will avoid processing files it
detects as binary. With -a, annotate will generate an annotation
anyway, probably with undesirable results.</pre>
<pre>options:
-r, --rev          annotate the specified revision
-f, --follow       follow file copies and renames
-a, --text         treat all files as text
-u, --user         list the author (long with -v)
-d, --date         list the date (short with -q)
-n, --number       list the revision number (default)
-c, --changeset    list the changeset
-l, --line-number  show line number at the first appearance
-I, --include      include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude      exclude names matching the given patterns</pre>
<pre>aliases: blame</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="archive"></a><dl>
<dt>
archive[OPTION]&#8230; DEST
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    By default, the revision used is the parent of the working
    directory; use "-r" to specify a different revision.
</p>
<pre>To specify the type of archive to create, use "-t". Valid
types are:</pre>
<pre>"files" (default): a directory full of files
"tar": tar archive, uncompressed
"tbz2": tar archive, compressed using bzip2
"tgz": tar archive, compressed using gzip
"uzip": zip archive, uncompressed
"zip": zip archive, compressed using deflate</pre>
<pre>The exact name of the destination archive or directory is given
using a format string; see "hg help export" for details.</pre>
<pre>Each member added to an archive file has a directory prefix
prepended. Use "-p" to specify a format string for the prefix.
The default is the basename of the archive, with suffixes removed.</pre>
<pre>options:
--no-decode    do not pass files through decoders
-p, --prefix   directory prefix for files in archive
-r, --rev      revision to distribute
-t, --type     type of distribution to create
-I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="backout"></a><dl>
<dt>
backout[OPTION]&#8230; [-r] REV
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Commit the backed out changes as a new changeset. The new
    changeset is a child of the backed out changeset.
</p>
<pre>If you back out a changeset other than the tip, a new head is
created. This head will be the new tip and you should merge this
backout changeset with another head (current one by default).</pre>
<pre>The --merge option remembers the parent of the working directory
before starting the backout, then merges the new head with that
changeset afterwards. This saves you from doing the merge by
hand. The result of this merge is not committed, as with a normal
merge.</pre>
<pre>See 'hg help dates' for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.</pre>
<pre>options:
--merge        merge with old dirstate parent after backout
--parent       parent to choose when backing out merge
-r, --rev      revision to backout
-I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns
-m, --message  use &lt;text&gt; as commit message
-l, --logfile  read commit message from &lt;file&gt;
-d, --date     record datecode as commit date
-u, --user     record user as committer</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="bisect"></a><dl>
<dt>
bisect[-gbsr] [-c CMD] [REV]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    This command helps to find changesets which introduce problems.
    To use, mark the earliest changeset you know exhibits the problem
    as bad, then mark the latest changeset which is free from the
    problem as good. Bisect will update your working directory to a
    revision for testing (unless the --noupdate option is specified).
    Once you have performed tests, mark the working directory as bad
    or good and bisect will either update to another candidate changeset
    or announce that it has found the bad revision.
</p>
<pre>As a shortcut, you can also use the revision argument to mark a
revision as good or bad without checking it out first.</pre>
<pre>If you supply a command it will be used for automatic bisection. Its exit
status will be used as flag to mark revision as bad or good. In case exit
status is 0 the revision is marked as good, 125 - skipped, 127 (command not
found) - bisection will be aborted; any other status bigger than 0 will
mark revision as bad.</pre>
<pre>options:
-r, --reset     reset bisect state
-g, --good      mark changeset good
-b, --bad       mark changeset bad
-s, --skip      skip testing changeset
-c, --command   use command to check changeset state
-U, --noupdate  do not update to target</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="branch"></a><dl>
<dt>
branch[-fC] [NAME]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    With no argument, show the current branch name. With one argument,
    set the working directory branch name (the branch does not exist in
    the repository until the next commit).
</p>
<pre>Unless --force is specified, branch will not let you set a
branch name that shadows an existing branch.</pre>
<pre>Use --clean to reset the working directory branch to that of the
parent of the working directory, negating a previous branch change.</pre>
<pre>Use the command 'hg update' to switch to an existing branch.</pre>
<pre>options:
-f, --force  set branch name even if it shadows an existing branch
-C, --clean  reset branch name to parent branch name</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="branches"></a><dl>
<dt>
branches[-a]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    List the repository&#8217;s named branches, indicating which ones are
    inactive. If active is specified, only show active branches.
</p>
<pre>A branch is considered active if it contains repository heads.</pre>
<pre>Use the command 'hg update' to switch to an existing branch.</pre>
<pre>options:
-a, --active  show only branches that have unmerged heads</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="bundle"></a><dl>
<dt>
bundle[-f] [-a] [-r REV]&#8230; [--base REV]&#8230; FILE [DEST]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Generate a compressed changegroup file collecting changesets not
    known to be in another repository.
</p>
<pre>If no destination repository is specified the destination is
assumed to have all the nodes specified by one or more --base
parameters. To create a bundle containing all changesets, use
--all (or --base null). To change the compression method applied,
use the -t option (by default, bundles are compressed using bz2).</pre>
<pre>The bundle file can then be transferred using conventional means and
applied to another repository with the unbundle or pull command.
This is useful when direct push and pull are not available or when
exporting an entire repository is undesirable.</pre>
<pre>Applying bundles preserves all changeset contents including
permissions, copy/rename information, and revision history.</pre>
<pre>options:
-f, --force  run even when remote repository is unrelated
-r, --rev    a changeset up to which you would like to bundle
--base       a base changeset to specify instead of a destination
-a, --all    bundle all changesets in the repository
-t, --type   bundle compression type to use (default: bzip2)
-e, --ssh    specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd  specify hg command to run on the remote side</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="cat"></a><dl>
<dt>
cat[OPTION]&#8230; FILE&#8230;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Print the specified files as they were at the given revision.
    If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used,
    or tip if no revision is checked out.
</p>
<pre>Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the file is
given using a format string. The formatting rules are the same as
for the export command, with the following additions:</pre>
<pre>%s   basename of file being printed
%d   dirname of file being printed, or '.' if in repo root
%p   root-relative path name of file being printed</pre>
<pre>options:
-o, --output   print output to file with formatted name
-r, --rev      print the given revision
--decode       apply any matching decode filter
-I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="clone"></a><dl>
<dt>
clone[OPTION]&#8230; SOURCE [DEST]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.
</p>
<pre>If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
basename of the source.</pre>
<pre>The location of the source is added to the new repository's
.hg/hgrc file, as the default to be used for future pulls.</pre>
<pre>For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever the source
and destination are on the same filesystem (note this applies only
to the repository data, not to the checked out files). Some
filesystems, such as AFS, implement hardlinking incorrectly, but
do not report errors. In these cases, use the --pull option to
avoid hardlinking.</pre>
<pre>In some cases, you can clone repositories and checked out files
using full hardlinks with</pre>
<pre>$ cp -al REPO REPOCLONE</pre>
<pre>This is the fastest way to clone, but it is not always safe.  The
operation is not atomic (making sure REPO is not modified during
the operation is up to you) and you have to make sure your editor
breaks hardlinks (Emacs and most Linux Kernel tools do so).  Also,
this is not compatible with certain extensions that place their
metadata under the .hg directory, such as mq.</pre>
<pre>If you use the -r option to clone up to a specific revision, no
subsequent revisions will be present in the cloned repository.
This option implies --pull, even on local repositories.</pre>
<pre>If the -U option is used, the new clone will contain only a repository
(.hg) and no working copy (the working copy parent is the null revision).</pre>
<pre>See 'hg help urls' for valid source format details.</pre>
<pre>It is possible to specify an ssh:// URL as the destination, but no
.hg/hgrc and working directory will be created on the remote side.
Look at the help text for urls for important details about ssh:// URLs.</pre>
<pre>options:
-U, --noupdate  the clone will only contain a repository (no
                working copy)
-r, --rev       a changeset you would like to have after cloning
--pull          use pull protocol to copy metadata
--uncompressed  use uncompressed transfer (fast over LAN)
-e, --ssh       specify ssh command to use
--remotecmd     specify hg command to run on the remote side</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="commit"></a><dl>
<dt>
commit[OPTION]&#8230; [FILE]&#8230;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Commit changes to the given files into the repository.
</p>
<pre>If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by "hg status"
will be committed.</pre>
<pre>If you are committing the result of a merge, do not provide any
file names or -I/-X filters.</pre>
<pre>If no commit message is specified, the configured editor is started to
prompt you for a message.</pre>
<pre>See 'hg help dates' for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.</pre>
<pre>options:
-A, --addremove  mark new/missing files as added/removed before
                 committing
--close-branch   mark a branch as closed, hiding it from the
                 branch list
-I, --include    include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude    exclude names matching the given patterns
-m, --message    use &lt;text&gt; as commit message
-l, --logfile    read commit message from &lt;file&gt;
-d, --date       record datecode as commit date

<p>
    Mark dest as having copies of source files. If dest is a
    directory, copies are put in that directory. If dest is a file,
    the source must be a single file.
</p>
<pre>By default, this command copies the contents of files as they
stand in the working directory. If invoked with --after, the
operation is recorded, but no copying is performed.</pre>
<pre>This command takes effect with the next commit. To undo a copy
before that, see hg revert.</pre>
<pre>options:
-A, --after    record a copy that has already occurred
-f, --force    forcibly copy over an existing managed file
-I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
-X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns

<a name="diff"></a><dl>
<dt>
diff[OPTION]&#8230; [-r REV1 [-r REV2]] [FILE]&#8230;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Show differences between revisions for the specified files.
</p>
<pre>Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.</pre>
<pre>NOTE: diff may generate unexpected results for merges, as it will
default to comparing against the working directory's first parent
changeset if no revisions are specified.</pre>
<pre>When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown
between those revisions. If only one revision is specified then
that revision is compared to the working directory, and, when no
revisions are specified, the working directory files are compared
to its parent.</pre>
<pre>Without the -a option, diff will avoid generating diffs of files
it detects as binary. With -a, diff will generate a diff anyway,
probably with undesirable results.</pre>
<pre>Use the --git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff
format. For more information, read hg help diffs.</pre>

-p, --show-function        show which function each change is in
-w, --ignore-all-space     ignore white space when comparing lines
-b, --ignore-space-change  ignore changes in the amount of white
                           space
-B, --ignore-blank-lines   ignore changes whose lines are all

<a name="export"></a><dl>
<dt>
export[OPTION]&#8230; [-o OUTFILESPEC] REV&#8230;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Print the changeset header and diffs for one or more revisions.
</p>
<pre>The information shown in the changeset header is: author,
changeset hash, parent(s) and commit comment.</pre>
<pre>NOTE: export may generate unexpected diff output for merge changesets,
as it will compare the merge changeset against its first parent only.</pre>
<pre>Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the file is
given using a format string. The formatting rules are as follows:</pre>
<pre>%%   literal "%" character
%H   changeset hash (40 bytes of hexadecimal)
%N   number of patches being generated
%R   changeset revision number
%b   basename of the exporting repository
%h   short-form changeset hash (12 bytes of hexadecimal)
%n   zero-padded sequence number, starting at 1
%r   zero-padded changeset revision number</pre>
<pre>Without the -a option, export will avoid generating diffs of files
it detects as binary. With -a, export will generate a diff anyway,
probably with undesirable results.</pre>
<pre>Use the --git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff
format. Read the diffs help topic for more information.</pre>
<pre>With the --switch-parent option, the diff will be against the second
parent. It can be useful to review a merge.</pre>
<pre>options:
-o, --output     print output to file with formatted name
--switch-parent  diff against the second parent
-a, --text       treat all files as text

<p>
    Search revisions of files for a regular expression.
</p>
<pre>This command behaves differently than Unix grep. It only accepts
Python/Perl regexps. It searches repository history, not the
working directory. It always prints the revision number in which
a match appears.</pre>
<pre>By default, grep only prints output for the first revision of a
file in which it finds a match. To get it to print every revision
that contains a change in match status ("-" for a match that
becomes a non-match, or "+" for a non-match that becomes a match),
use the --all flag.</pre>
<pre>options:
-0, --print0              end fields with NUL
--all                     print all revisions that match
-f, --follow              follow changeset history, or file
                          history across copies and renames
-i, --ignore-case         ignore case when matching
-l, --files-with-matches  print only filenames and revs that match

<p>
    With no arguments, show all repository head changesets.
</p>
<pre>If branch or revisions names are given this will show the heads of
the specified branches or the branches those revisions are tagged
with.</pre>
<pre>Repository "heads" are changesets that don't have child

    Import a list of patches and commit them individually.
</p>
<pre>If there are outstanding changes in the working directory, import
will abort unless given the -f flag.</pre>
<pre>You can import a patch straight from a mail message. Even patches
as attachments work (body part must be type text/plain or
text/x-patch to be used). From and Subject headers of email
message are used as default committer and commit message. All
text/plain body parts before first diff are added to commit
message.</pre>
<pre>If the imported patch was generated by hg export, user and description
from patch override values from message headers and body. Values
given on command line with -m and -u override these.</pre>
<pre>If --exact is specified, import will set the working directory
to the parent of each patch before applying it, and will abort
if the resulting changeset has a different ID than the one
recorded in the patch. This may happen due to character set
problems or other deficiencies in the text patch format.</pre>
<pre>With --similarity, hg will attempt to discover renames and copies
in the patch in the same way as 'addremove'.</pre>
<pre>To read a patch from standard input, use patch name "-".
See 'hg help dates' for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.</pre>
<pre>options:
-p, --strip       directory strip option for patch. This has the
                  same meaning as the corresponding patch option

<pre>File history is shown without following rename or copy history of
files. Use -f/--follow with a file name to follow history across
renames and copies. --follow without a file name will only show
ancestors or descendants of the starting revision. --follow-first
only follows the first parent of merge revisions.</pre>
<pre>If no revision range is specified, the default is tip:0 unless
--follow is set, in which case the working directory parent is
used as the starting revision.</pre>
<pre>See 'hg help dates' for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.</pre>
<pre>By default this command outputs: changeset id and hash, tags,
non-trivial parents, user, date and time, and a summary for each
commit. When the -v/--verbose switch is used, the list of changed
files and full commit message is shown.</pre>
<pre>NOTE: log -p may generate unexpected diff output for merge
changesets, as it will only compare the merge changeset against
its first parent. Also, the files: list will only reflect files
that are different from BOTH parents.</pre>

<p>
    Push changes from the local repository to the given destination.
</p>
<pre>This is the symmetrical operation for pull. It helps to move
changes from the current repository to a different one. If the
destination is local this is identical to a pull in that directory
from the current one.</pre>
<pre>By default, push will refuse to run if it detects the result would
increase the number of remote heads. This generally indicates the
the client has forgotten to pull and merge before pushing.</pre>

<pre>This only removes files from the current branch, not from the entire
project history. -A can be used to remove only files that have already
been deleted, -f can be used to force deletion, and -Af can be used
to remove files from the next revision without deleting them.</pre>
<pre>The following table details the behavior of remove for different file
states (columns) and option combinations (rows). The file states are
Added, Clean, Modified and Missing (as reported by hg status). The
actions are Warn, Remove (from branch) and Delete (from disk).</pre>

</p>
<pre>By default, this command copies the contents of files as they

<dd>
<p>
    (use update -r to check out earlier revisions, revert does not
    change the working dir parents)
</p>
<pre>With no revision specified, revert the named files or directories
to the contents they had in the parent of the working directory.
This restores the contents of the affected files to an unmodified
state and unschedules adds, removes, copies, and renames. If the
working directory has two parents, you must explicitly specify the
revision to revert to.</pre>
<pre>Using the -r option, revert the given files or directories to their
contents as of a specific revision. This can be helpful to "roll
back" some or all of an earlier change.
See 'hg help dates' for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.</pre>
<pre>Revert modifies the working directory. It does not commit any
changes, or change the parent of the working directory. If you
revert to a revision other than the parent of the working
directory, the reverted files will thus appear modified
afterwards.</pre>
<pre>If a file has been deleted, it is restored. If the executable
mode of a file was changed, it is reset.</pre>
<pre>If names are given, all files matching the names are reverted.
If no arguments are given, no files are reverted.</pre>
<pre>Modified files are saved with a .orig suffix before reverting.
To disable these backups, use --no-backup.</pre>
<pre>options:
-a, --all      revert all changes when no arguments given
-d, --date     tipmost revision matching date
-r, --rev      revision to revert to
--no-backup    do not save backup copies of files

<a name="rollback"></a><dl>
<dt>
rollback
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    This command should be used with care. There is only one level of
    rollback, and there is no way to undo a rollback. It will also
    restore the dirstate at the time of the last transaction, losing
    any dirstate changes since that time.
</p>
<pre>Transactions are used to encapsulate the effects of all commands
that create new changesets or propagate existing changesets into a
repository. For example, the following commands are transactional,
and their effects can be rolled back:</pre>
<pre>commit
import
pull
push (with this repository as destination)
unbundle</pre>
<pre>This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once
changes are visible for pull by other users, rolling a transaction
back locally is ineffective (someone else may already have pulled
the changes). Furthermore, a race is possible with readers of the
repository; for example an in-progress pull from the repository
may fail if a rollback is performed.</pre>

<p>
    Name a particular revision using &lt;name&gt;.
</p>
<pre>Tags are used to name particular revisions of the repository and are
very useful to compare different revisions, to go back to significant
earlier versions or to mark branch points as releases, etc.</pre>
<pre>If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used,
or tip if no revision is checked out.</pre>
<pre>To facilitate version control, distribution, and merging of tags,
they are stored as a file named ".hgtags" which is managed
similarly to other project files and can be hand-edited if
necessary. The file '.hg/localtags' is used for local tags (not
shared among repositories).</pre>
<pre>See 'hg help dates' for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.</pre>
<pre>options:
-f, --force    replace existing tag
-l, --local    make the tag local
-r, --rev      revision to tag

</dd>
</dl>
<a name="tip"></a><dl>
<dt>
tip[-p]
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    The tip revision (usually just called the tip) is the most
    recently added changeset in the repository, the most recently
    changed head.
</p>
<pre>If you have just made a commit, that commit will be the tip. If
you have just pulled changes from another repository, the tip of
that repository becomes the current tip. The "tip" tag is special
and cannot be renamed or assigned to a different changeset.</pre>

</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Update the repository&#8217;s working directory to the specified revision,
    or the tip of the current branch if none is specified. Use null as
    the revision to remove the working copy (like <em>hg clone -U</em>).
</p>
<pre>When the working dir contains no uncommitted changes, it will be
replaced by the state of the requested revision from the repo.  When
the requested revision is on a different branch, the working dir
will additionally be switched to that branch.</pre>
<pre>When there are uncommitted changes, use option -C to discard them,
forcibly replacing the state of the working dir with the requested
revision.</pre>
<pre>When there are uncommitted changes and option -C is not used, and
the parent revision and requested revision are on the same branch,
and one of them is an ancestor of the other, then the new working
directory will contain the requested revision merged with the
uncommitted changes.  Otherwise, the update will fail with a
suggestion to use 'merge' or 'update -C' instead.</pre>
<pre>If you want to update just one file to an older revision, use revert.</pre>
<pre>See 'hg help dates' for a list of formats valid for --date.</pre>

<h2><a name="_date_formats"></a>DATE FORMATS</h2>
<pre>Some commands allow the user to specify a date, e.g.:
* backout, commit, import, tag: Specify the commit date.
* log, revert, update: Select revision(s) by date.</pre>
<pre>Many date formats are valid. Here are some examples:</pre>
<pre>"Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006" (local timezone assumed)
"Dec 6 13:18 -0600" (year assumed, time offset provided)
"Dec 6 13:18 UTC" (UTC and GMT are aliases for +0000)
"Dec 6" (midnight)
"13:18" (today assumed)
"3:39" (3:39AM assumed)
"3:39pm" (15:39)
"2006-12-06 13:18:29" (ISO 8601 format)
"2006-12-6 13:18"
"2006-12-6"
"12-6"
"12/6"
"12/6/6" (Dec 6 2006)</pre>
<pre>Lastly, there is Mercurial's internal format:</pre>
<pre>"1165432709 0" (Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 UTC)</pre>
<pre>This is the internal representation format for dates. unixtime is
the number of seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00 UTC). offset
is the offset of the local timezone, in seconds west of UTC (negative
if the timezone is east of UTC).</pre>
<pre>The log command also accepts date ranges:</pre>
<pre>"&lt;{datetime}" - at or before a given date/time
"&gt;{datetime}" - on or after a given date/time
"{datetime} to {datetime}" - a date range, inclusive
"-{days}" - within a given number of days of today</pre>
<hr />
<h2><a name="_file_name_patterns"></a>FILE NAME PATTERNS</h2>
<pre>Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more
files at a time.</pre>
<pre>By default, Mercurial treats filenames as shell-style extended
glob patterns.</pre>
<pre>Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.</pre>
<pre>To use a plain path name without any pattern matching, start it
with "path:". These path names must completely match starting at
the current repository root.</pre>
<pre>To use an extended glob, start a name with "glob:". Globs are
rooted at the current directory; a glob such as "*.c" will only
match files in the current directory ending with ".c".</pre>
<pre>The supported glob syntax extensions are "**" to match any string
across path separators and "{a,b}" to mean "a or b".</pre>
<pre>To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with "re:".
Regexp pattern matching is anchored at the root of the repository.</pre>
<pre>Plain examples:</pre>
<pre>path:foo/bar   a name bar in a directory named foo in the root of
               the repository
path:path:name a file or directory named "path:name"</pre>
<pre>Glob examples:</pre>
<pre>glob:*.c       any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
*.c            any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
**.c           any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of the
               current directory including itself.
foo/*.c        any name ending in ".c" in the directory foo
foo/**.c       any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of foo
               including itself.</pre>
<pre>Regexp examples:</pre>
<pre>re:.*\.c$      any name ending in ".c", anywhere in the repository</pre>

<dt>
HGENCODING
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    This overrides the default locale setting detected by Mercurial.
    This setting is used to convert data including usernames,

<dd>
<p>
    This sets Mercurial&#8217;s behavior for handling unknown characters
    while transcoding user input. The default is "strict", which
    causes Mercurial to abort if it can&#8217;t map a character. Other
    settings include "replace", which replaces unknown characters, and

<dd>
<p>
    Sometimes Mercurial needs to open a text file in an editor
    for a user to modify, for example when writing commit messages.
    The editor it uses is determined by looking at the environment
    variables HGEDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR, in that order. The first
    non-empty one is chosen. If all of them are empty, the editor
    defaults to <em>vi</em>.

<hr />
<h2><a name="_specifying_single_revisions"></a>SPECIFYING SINGLE REVISIONS</h2>
<pre>Mercurial supports several ways to specify individual
revisions.</pre>
<pre>A plain integer is treated as a revision number. Negative
integers are treated as toplogical offsets from the tip, with
-1 denoting the tip. As such, negative numbers are only useful
if you've memorized your local tree numbers and want to save
typing a single digit. This editor suggests copy and paste.</pre>
<pre>A 40-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision
identifier.</pre>
<pre>A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as a
unique revision identifier, and referred to as a short-form
identifier. A short-form identifier is only valid if it is the
prefix of exactly one full-length identifier.</pre>
<pre>Any other string is treated as a tag name, which is a symbolic
name associated with a revision identifier. Tag names may not
contain the ":" character.</pre>
<pre>The reserved name "tip" is a special tag that always identifies
the most recent revision.</pre>
<pre>The reserved name "null" indicates the null revision. This is the
revision of an empty repository, and the parent of revision 0.</pre>
<pre>The reserved name "." indicates the working directory parent. If
no working directory is checked out, it is equivalent to null.
If an uncommitted merge is in progress, "." is the revision of
the first parent.</pre>
<hr />
<h2><a name="_specifying_multiple_revisions"></a>SPECIFYING MULTIPLE REVISIONS</h2>
<pre>When Mercurial accepts more than one revision, they may be
specified individually, or provided as a topologically continuous
range, separated by the ":" character.</pre>
<pre>The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where BEGIN and END
are revision identifiers. Both BEGIN and END are optional. If
BEGIN is not specified, it defaults to revision number 0. If END
is not specified, it defaults to the tip. The range ":" thus
means "all revisions".</pre>
<pre>If BEGIN is greater than END, revisions are treated in reverse
order.</pre>
<pre>A range acts as a closed interval. This means that a range of 3:5
gives 3, 4 and 5. Similarly, a range of 9:6 gives 9, 8, 7, and 6.</pre>
<hr />
<h2><a name="_diff_formats"></a>DIFF FORMATS</h2>
<pre>Mercurial's default format for showing changes between two versions
of a file is compatible with the unified format of GNU diff, which
can be used by GNU patch and many other standard tools.</pre>
<pre>While this standard format is often enough, it does not encode the
following information:</pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
executable status and other permission bits
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
copy or rename information
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
changes in binary files
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
creation or deletion of empty files
</p>
<pre>Mercurial also supports the extended diff format from the git VCS
which addresses these limitations. The git diff format is not
produced by default because a few widespread tools still do not
understand this format.</pre>
<pre>This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial repository
(e.g. with "hg export"), you should be careful about things like
file copies and renames or other things mentioned above, because
when applying a standard diff to a different repository, this extra
information is lost. Mercurial's internal operations (like push and
pull) are not affected by this, because they use an internal binary
format for communicating changes.</pre>
<pre>To make Mercurial produce the git extended diff format, use the
--git option available for many commands, or set 'git = True' in the
[diff] section of your hgrc. You do not need to set this option when
importing diffs in this format or using them in the mq extension.</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><a name="_template_usage"></a>TEMPLATE USAGE</h2>
<pre>Mercurial allows you to customize output of commands through
templates. You can either pass in a template from the command line,
via the --template option, or select an existing template-style (--style).</pre>
<pre>You can customize output for any "log-like" command: log, outgoing,
incoming, tip, parents, heads and glog.</pre>
<pre>Three styles are packaged with Mercurial: default (the style used
when no explicit preference is passed), compact and changelog. Usage:</pre>
<pre>$ hg log -r1 --style changelog</pre>
<pre>A template is a piece of text, with markup to invoke variable expansion:</pre>
<pre>$ hg log -r1 --template "{node}\n"
b56ce7b07c52de7d5fd79fb89701ea538af65746</pre>
<pre>Strings in curly braces are called keywords. The availability of
keywords depends on the exact context of the templater. These keywords
are usually available for templating a log-like command:</pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
author: String. The unmodified author of the changeset.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
branches: String. The name of the branch on which the changeset
          was committed. Will be empty if the branch name was default.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
date: Date information. The date when the changeset was committed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
desc: String. The text of the changeset description.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
files: List of strings. All files modified, added, or removed by
          this changeset.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
file_adds: List of strings. Files added by this changeset.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
file_mods: List of strings. Files modified by this changeset.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
file_dels: List of strings. Files removed by this changeset.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
node: String. The changeset identification hash, as a 40-character
          hexadecimal string.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
parents: List of strings. The parents of the changeset.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
rev: Integer. The repository-local changeset revision number.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
tags: List of strings. Any tags associated with the changeset.
</p>
<pre>The "date" keyword does not produce human-readable output. If you
want to use a date in your output, you can use a filter to process it.
Filters are functions which return a string based on the input variable.
You can also use a chain of filters to get the desired output:</pre>
<pre>$ hg tip --template "{date|isodate}\n"
2008-08-21 18:22 +0000</pre>
<pre>List of filters:</pre>
</li>
<li>

</p>
</li>
<li>

<hr />
<h2><a name="_url_paths"></a>URL PATHS</h2>
<pre>Valid URLs are of the form:</pre>
<pre>local/filesystem/path (or file://local/filesystem/path)
http://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path]
https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path]
ssh://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path]</pre>
<pre>Paths in the local filesystem can either point to Mercurial
repositories or to bundle files (as created by 'hg bundle' or
'hg incoming --bundle').</pre>
<pre>An optional identifier after # indicates a particular branch, tag,
or changeset to use from the remote repository.</pre>
<pre>Some features, such as pushing to http:// and https:// URLs are
only possible if the feature is explicitly enabled on the
remote Mercurial server.</pre>
<pre>Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:
- SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination machine
  and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with as remotecmd.
- path is relative to the remote user's home directory by default.
  Use an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path:
    ssh://example.com//tmp/repository
- Mercurial doesn't use its own compression via SSH; the right thing
  to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.:
    Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com
      Compression no
    Host *
      Compression yes
  Alternatively specify "ssh -C" as your ssh command in your hgrc or
  with the --ssh command line option.</pre>
<pre>These urls can all be stored in your hgrc with path aliases under the
[paths] section like so:
[paths]
alias1 = URL1
alias2 = URL2
...</pre>
<pre>You can then use the alias for any command that uses a url (for example
'hg pull alias1' would pull from the 'alias1' path).</pre>
<pre>Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults
when you do not provide the url to a command:</pre>
<pre>default:
  When you create a repository with hg clone, the clone command saves
  the location of the source repository as the new repository's
  'default' path. This is then used when you omit path from push-
  and pull-like commands (including in and out).</pre>
<pre>default-push:
  The push command will look for a path named 'default-push', and
  prefer it over 'default' if both are defined.</pre>

    This file contains defaults and configuration. Values in .hg/hgrc
    override those in $HOME/.hgrc, and these override settings made in the
    global /etc/mercurial/hgrc configuration. See hgrc(5) for details of
    the contents and format of these files.

<p>Some commands (e.g. revert) produce backup files ending in .orig, if
the .orig file already exists and is not tracked by Mercurial, it
will be overwritten.</p>
