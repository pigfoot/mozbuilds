<h2><a name="_name"></a>NAME</h2>
<p>hgrc - configuration files for Mercurial</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="_synopsis"></a>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p>The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control
aspects of its behaviour.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="_files"></a>FILES</h2>
<p>Mercurial reads configuration data from several files, if they exist.
The names of these files depend on the system on which Mercurial is
installed. *.rc files from a single directory are read in
alphabetical order, later ones overriding earlier ones. Where
multiple paths are given below, settings from later paths override
earlier ones.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
(Unix) &lt;install-root&gt;/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc
</dt>
<dt>
(Unix) &lt;install-root&gt;/etc/mercurial/hgrc
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Per-installation configuration files, searched for in the
    directory where Mercurial is installed. &lt;install-root&gt; is the
    parent directory of the hg executable (or symlink) being run.
    For example, if installed in /shared/tools/bin/hg, Mercurial will
    look in /shared/tools/etc/mercurial/hgrc. Options in these files
    apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any
    directory.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
(Unix) /etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc
</dt>
<dt>
(Unix) /etc/mercurial/hgrc
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Per-system configuration files, for the system on which Mercurial
    is running. Options in these files apply to all Mercurial
    commands executed by any user in any directory. Options in these
    files override per-installation options.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
(Windows) &lt;install-dir&gt;\Mercurial.ini
</dt>
<dt>
or else
</dt>
<dt>
(Windows) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mercurial
</dt>
<dt>
or else
</dt>
<dt>
(Windows) C:\Mercurial\Mercurial.ini
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Per-installation/system configuration files, for the system on
    which Mercurial is running. Options in these files apply to all
    Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory.
    Registry keys contain PATH-like strings, every part of which must
    reference a Mercurial.ini file or be a directory where *.rc files
    will be read.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
(Unix) $HOME/.hgrc
</dt>
<dt>
(Windows) %HOME%\Mercurial.ini
</dt>
<dt>
(Windows) %HOME%\.hgrc

</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Per-user configuration file(s), for the user running Mercurial.
    On Windows 9x, %HOME% is replaced by %APPDATA%.
    Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands executed
    by this user in any directory. Options in thes files override
    per-installation and per-system options.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
(Unix, Windows) &lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Per-repository configuration options that only apply in a
    particular repository. This file is not version-controlled, and
    will not get transferred during a "clone" operation. Options in
    this file override options in all other configuration files.
    On Unix, most of this file will be ignored if it doesn&#8217;t belong
    to a trusted user or to a trusted group. See the documentation
    for the trusted section below for more details.
</p>

</dl>
<hr />
<h2><a name="_syntax"></a>SYNTAX</h2>
<p>A configuration file consists of sections, led by a "[section]" header
and followed by "name: value" entries; "name=value" is also accepted.</p>
<pre>[spam]
eggs=ham
green=
   eggs</pre>
<p>Each line contains one entry. If the lines that follow are indented,
they are treated as continuations of that entry.</p>
<p>Leading whitespace is removed from values. Empty lines are skipped.</p>
<p>The optional values can contain format strings which refer to other
values in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section.</p>
<p>Lines beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to provide
comments.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="_sections"></a>SECTIONS</h2>
<p>This section describes the different sections that may appear in a
Mercurial "hgrc" file, the purpose of each section, its possible
keys, and their possible values.</p>
<a name="decode"></a><dl>
<dt>
decode/encode
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Filters for transforming files on checkout/checkin. This would
  typically be used for newline processing or other
  localization/canonicalization of files.
</p>
<pre>Filters consist of a filter pattern followed by a filter command.
Filter patterns are globs by default, rooted at the repository
root. For example, to match any file ending in ".txt" in the root
directory only, use the pattern "*.txt". To match any file ending
in ".c" anywhere in the repository, use the pattern "**.c".</pre>
<pre>The filter command can start with a specifier, either "pipe:" or
"tempfile:". If no specifier is given, "pipe:" is used by default.</pre>
<pre>A "pipe:" command must accept data on stdin and return the
transformed data on stdout.</pre>
<pre>Pipe example:</pre>
<pre>[encode]
# uncompress gzip files on checkin to improve delta compression
# note: not necessarily a good idea, just an example
*.gz = pipe: gunzip</pre>
<pre>[decode]
# recompress gzip files when writing them to the working dir (we
# can safely omit "pipe:", because it's the default)
*.gz = gzip</pre>
<pre>A "tempfile:" command is a template. The string INFILE is replaced
with the name of a temporary file that contains the data to be
filtered by the command. The string OUTFILE is replaced with the
name of an empty temporary file, where the filtered data must be
written by the command.</pre>
<pre>NOTE: the tempfile mechanism is recommended for Windows systems,
where the standard shell I/O redirection operators often have
strange effects and may corrupt the contents of your files.</pre>
<pre>The most common usage is for LF &lt;-&gt; CRLF translation on Windows.
For this, use the "smart" convertors which check for binary files:</pre>
<pre>[extensions]
hgext.win32text =
[encode]
** = cleverencode:
[decode]
** = cleverdecode:</pre>
<pre>or if you only want to translate certain files:</pre>
<pre>[extensions]
hgext.win32text =
[encode]
**.txt = dumbencode:
[decode]
**.txt = dumbdecode:</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="defaults"></a><dl>
<dt>
defaults
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Use the [defaults] section to define command defaults, i.e. the
  default options/arguments to pass to the specified commands.
</p>
<pre>The following example makes 'hg log' run in verbose mode, and
'hg status' show only the modified files, by default.</pre>
<pre>[defaults]
log = -v
status = -m</pre>
<pre>The actual commands, instead of their aliases, must be used when
defining command defaults. The command defaults will also be
applied to the aliases of the commands defined.</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="diff"></a><dl>
<dt>

email
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Settings for extensions that send email messages.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
from
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Email address to use in "From" header and SMTP envelope
    of outgoing messages.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
to
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Comma-separated list of recipients' email addresses.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
cc
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Comma-separated list of carbon copy recipients'
    email addresses.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
bcc
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Comma-separated list of blind carbon copy
    recipients' email addresses. Cannot be set interactively.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
method
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Method to use to send email messages. If value is
    "smtp" (default), use SMTP (see section "[smtp]" for
    configuration). Otherwise, use as name of program to run that
    acts like sendmail (takes "-f" option for sender, list of
    recipients on command line, message on stdin). Normally, setting
    this to "sendmail" or "/usr/sbin/sendmail" is enough to use
    sendmail to send messages.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
charsets
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Comma-separated list of charsets considered
    convenient for recipients. Addresses, headers, and parts not
    containing patches of outgoing messages will be encoded in
    the first charset to which conversion from local encoding
    ($HGENCODING, ui.fallbackencoding) succeeds. If correct
    conversion fails, the text in question is sent as is.
    Defaults to empty (explicit) list.
</p>
<pre>Order of outgoing email charsets:</pre>
<pre>us-ascii             always first, regardless of settings
email.charsets       in order given by user
ui.fallbackencoding  if not in email.charsets
$HGENCODING          if not in email.charsets
utf-8                always last, regardless of settings</pre>
<pre>Email example:</pre>
<pre>[email]
from = Joseph User &lt;joe.user@example.com&gt;
method = /usr/sbin/sendmail
# charsets for western europeans
# us-ascii, utf-8 omitted, as they are tried first and last
charsets = iso-8859-1, iso-8859-15, windows-1252</pre>

<a name="extensions"></a><dl>
<dt>
extensions
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Mercurial has an extension mechanism for adding new features. To
  enable an extension, create an entry for it in this section.
</p>
<pre>If you know that the extension is already in Python's search path,
you can give the name of the module, followed by "=", with nothing
after the "=".</pre>
<pre>Otherwise, give a name that you choose, followed by "=", followed by
the path to the ".py" file (including the file name extension) that
defines the extension.</pre>
<pre>To explicitly disable an extension that is enabled in an hgrc of
broader scope, prepend its path with '!', as in
'hgext.foo = !/ext/path' or 'hgext.foo = !' when no path is supplied.</pre>
<pre>Example for ~/.hgrc:</pre>
<pre>[extensions]
# (the mq extension will get loaded from mercurial's path)
hgext.mq =
# (this extension will get loaded from the file specified)
myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="format"></a><dl>
<dt>
format
</dt>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>
usestore
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Enable or disable the "store" repository format which improves
    compatibility with systems that fold case or otherwise mangle
    filenames. Enabled by default. Disabling this option will allow
    you to store longer filenames in some situations at the expense of
    compatibility and ensures that the on-disk format of newly created
    repositories will be compatible with Mercurial before version 0.9.4.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
usefncache
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Enable or disable the "fncache" repository format which enhances
    the "store" repository format (which has to be enabled to use
    fncache) to allow longer filenames and avoids using Windows reserved
    names, e.g. "nul". Enabled by default. Disabling this option ensures
    that the on-disk format of newly created repositories will be
    compatible with Mercurial before version 1.1.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>
<a name="merge-patterns"></a><dl>
<dt>
merge-patterns
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  This section specifies merge tools to associate with particular file
  patterns. Tools matched here will take precedence over the default
  merge tool. Patterns are globs by default, rooted at the repository root.
</p>
<pre>Example:</pre>
<pre>[merge-patterns]
**.c = kdiff3
**.jpg = myimgmerge</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="merge-tools"></a><dl>
<dt>
merge-tools
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  This section configures external merge tools to use for file-level
  merges.
</p>
<pre>Example ~/.hgrc:</pre>
<pre>[merge-tools]
# Override stock tool location
kdiff3.executable = ~/bin/kdiff3
# Specify command line
kdiff3.args = $base $local $other -o $output
# Give higher priority
kdiff3.priority = 1</pre>
<pre># Define new tool
myHtmlTool.args = -m $local $other $base $output

</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    The arguments to pass to the tool executable. You can refer to the files
    being merged as well as the output file through these variables: $base,
    $local, $other, $output.
    Default: $local $base $other
</p>
</dd>
<dt>

    was selected by file pattern match.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
symlink
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    This tool can merge symlinks. Defaults to False, even if tool was
    selected by file pattern match.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>

</p>
</dd>
<dt>
regkey
</dt>
<dd>
<p>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="hooks"></a><dl>
<dt>
hooks
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Commands or Python functions that get automatically executed by
  various actions such as starting or finishing a commit. Multiple
  hooks can be run for the same action by appending a suffix to the
  action. Overriding a site-wide hook can be done by changing its
  value or setting it to an empty string.
</p>
<pre>Example .hg/hgrc:</pre>
<pre>[hooks]
# do not use the site-wide hook
incoming =
incoming.email = /my/email/hook
incoming.autobuild = /my/build/hook</pre>
<pre>Most hooks are run with environment variables set that give added
useful information. For each hook below, the environment variables
it is passed are listed with names of the form "$HG_foo".</pre>
<dl>
<dt>
changegroup
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run after a changegroup has been added via push, pull or
    unbundle. ID of the first new changeset is in $HG_NODE. URL from
    which changes came is in $HG_URL.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
commit
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run after a changeset has been created in the local repository.
    ID of the newly created changeset is in $HG_NODE. Parent
    changeset IDs are in $HG_PARENT1 and $HG_PARENT2.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
incoming
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run after a changeset has been pulled, pushed, or unbundled into
    the local repository. The ID of the newly arrived changeset is in
    $HG_NODE. URL that was source of changes came is in $HG_URL.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
outgoing
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run after sending changes from local repository to another. ID of
    first changeset sent is in $HG_NODE. Source of operation is in
    $HG_SOURCE; see "preoutgoing" hook for description.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
post-&lt;command&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run after successful invocations of the associated command. The
    contents of the command line are passed as $HG_ARGS and the result
    code in $HG_RESULT. Hook failure is ignored.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
pre-&lt;command&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run before executing the associated command. The contents of the
    command line are passed as $HG_ARGS. If the hook returns failure,
    the command doesn&#8217;t execute and Mercurial returns the failure code.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
prechangegroup
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run before a changegroup is added via push, pull or unbundle.
    Exit status 0 allows the changegroup to proceed. Non-zero status
    will cause the push, pull or unbundle to fail. URL from which
    changes will come is in $HG_URL.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
precommit
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run before starting a local commit. Exit status 0 allows the
    commit to proceed. Non-zero status will cause the commit to fail.
    Parent changeset IDs are in $HG_PARENT1 and $HG_PARENT2.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
preoutgoing
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run before collecting changes to send from the local repository to
    another. Non-zero status will cause failure. This lets you
    prevent pull over http or ssh. Also prevents against local pull,
    push (outbound) or bundle commands, but not effective, since you
    can just copy files instead then. Source of operation is in
    $HG_SOURCE. If "serve", operation is happening on behalf of
    remote ssh or http repository. If "push", "pull" or "bundle",
    operation is happening on behalf of repository on same system.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
pretag
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run before creating a tag. Exit status 0 allows the tag to be
    created. Non-zero status will cause the tag to fail. ID of
    changeset to tag is in $HG_NODE. Name of tag is in $HG_TAG. Tag
    is local if $HG_LOCAL=1, in repo if $HG_LOCAL=0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
pretxnchangegroup
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run after a changegroup has been added via push, pull or unbundle,
    but before the transaction has been committed. Changegroup is
    visible to hook program. This lets you validate incoming changes
    before accepting them. Passed the ID of the first new changeset
    in $HG_NODE. Exit status 0 allows the transaction to commit.
    Non-zero status will cause the transaction to be rolled back and
    the push, pull or unbundle will fail. URL that was source of
    changes is in $HG_URL.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
pretxncommit
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run after a changeset has been created but the transaction not yet
    committed. Changeset is visible to hook program. This lets you
    validate commit message and changes. Exit status 0 allows the
    commit to proceed. Non-zero status will cause the transaction to
    be rolled back. ID of changeset is in $HG_NODE. Parent changeset
    IDs are in $HG_PARENT1 and $HG_PARENT2.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
preupdate
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run before updating the working directory. Exit status 0 allows
    the update to proceed. Non-zero status will prevent the update.
    Changeset ID of first new parent is in $HG_PARENT1. If merge, ID
    of second new parent is in $HG_PARENT2.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
tag
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run after a tag is created. ID of tagged changeset is in
    $HG_NODE. Name of tag is in $HG_TAG. Tag is local if
    $HG_LOCAL=1, in repo if $HG_LOCAL=0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
update
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Run after updating the working directory. Changeset ID of first
    new parent is in $HG_PARENT1. If merge, ID of second new parent
    is in $HG_PARENT2. If update succeeded, $HG_ERROR=0. If update
    failed (e.g. because conflicts not resolved), $HG_ERROR=1.
</p>
<pre>Note: it is generally better to use standard hooks rather than the
generic pre- and post- command hooks as they are guaranteed to be
called in the appropriate contexts for influencing transactions.
Also, hooks like "commit" will be called in all contexts that
generate a commit (eg. tag) and not just the commit command.</pre>
<pre>Note2: Environment variables with empty values may not be passed to
hooks on platforms like Windows. For instance, $HG_PARENT2 will
not be available under Windows for non-merge changesets while being
set to an empty value under Unix-like systems.</pre>
<pre>The syntax for Python hooks is as follows:</pre>
<pre>hookname = python:modulename.submodule.callable</pre>
<pre>Python hooks are run within the Mercurial process. Each hook is
called with at least three keyword arguments: a ui object (keyword
"ui"), a repository object (keyword "repo"), and a "hooktype"
keyword that tells what kind of hook is used. Arguments listed as
environment variables above are passed as keyword arguments, with no
"HG_" prefix, and names in lower case.</pre>
<pre>If a Python hook returns a "true" value or raises an exception, this
is treated as failure of the hook.</pre>

<dt>
uncompressed
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Whether to allow clients to clone a repo using the uncompressed
    streaming protocol. This transfers about 40% more data than a
    regular clone, but uses less memory and CPU on both server and
    client. Over a LAN (100Mbps or better) or a very fast WAN, an
    uncompressed streaming clone is a lot faster (~10x) than a regular
    clone. Over most WAN connections (anything slower than about
    6Mbps), uncompressed streaming is slower, because of the extra
    data transfer overhead. Default is False.

<dd>
<p>
  For security reasons, Mercurial will not use the settings in
  the .hg/hgrc file from a repository if it doesn&#8217;t belong to a
  trusted user or to a trusted group. The main exception is the
  web interface, which automatically uses some safe settings, since
  it&#8217;s common to serve repositories from different users.
</p>
<pre>This section specifies what users and groups are trusted. The
current user is always trusted. To trust everybody, list a user
or a group with name "*".</pre>

</dd>
<dt>
askusername
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Whether to prompt for a username when committing. If True, and

<dt>
ignore
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    A file to read per-user ignore patterns from. This file should be in
    the same format as a repository-wide .hgignore file. This option
    supports hook syntax, so if you want to specify multiple ignore
    files, you can do so by setting something like
    "ignore.other = ~/.hgignore2". For details of the ignore file
    format, see the hgignore(5) man page.

    Typically a person&#8217;s name and email address, e.g. "Fred Widget
    &lt;<a href="mailto:fred@example.com">fred@example.com</a>&gt;". Default is $EMAIL or username@hostname.
    If the username in hgrc is empty, it has to be specified manually or
    in a different hgrc file (e.g. $HOME/.hgrc, if the admin set "username ="
    in the system hgrc).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>

</p>
</dd>
<dt>
allowbz2

    (DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .tar.bz2 downloading of repo revisions.
    Default is false.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
allowgz
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    (DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .tar.gz downloading of repo revisions.
    Default is false.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
allowpull
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Whether to allow pulling from the repository. Default is true.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
allow_push
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Whether to allow pushing to the repository. If empty or not set,
    push is not allowed. If the special value "*", any remote user
    can push, including unauthenticated users. Otherwise, the remote
    user must have been authenticated, and the authenticated user name
    must be present in this list (separated by whitespace or ",").
    The contents of the allow_push list are examined after the
    deny_push list.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
allow_read
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    If the user has not already been denied repository access due to the
    contents of deny_read, this list determines whether to grant repository
    access to the user. If this list is not empty, and the user is
    unauthenticated or not present in the list (separated by whitespace or ","),
    then access is denied for the user.  If the list is empty or not set, then
    access is permitted to all users by default.  Setting allow_read to the
    special value "*" is equivalent to it not being set (i.e. access is
    permitted to all users).  The contents of the allow_read list are examined
    after the deny_read list.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
allowzip
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    (DEPRECATED) Whether to allow .zip downloading of repo revisions.
    Default is false. This feature creates temporary files.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
baseurl
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Base URL to use when publishing URLs in other locations, so
    third-party tools like email notification hooks can construct URLs.
    Example: "http://hgserver/repos/"
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
contact
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Name or email address of the person in charge of the repository.
    Defaults to ui.username or $EMAIL or "unknown" if unset or empty.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
deny_push
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Whether to deny pushing to the repository. If empty or not set,
    push is not denied. If the special value "*", all remote users
    are denied push. Otherwise, unauthenticated users are all denied,
    and any authenticated user name present in this list (separated by
    whitespace or ",") is also denied. The contents of the deny_push
    list are examined before the allow_push list.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
deny_read
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Whether to deny reading/viewing of the repository.  If this list is not
    empty, unauthenticated users are all denied, and any authenticated user name
    present in this list (separated by whitespace or ",") is also denied access
    to the repository.  If set to the special value "*", all remote users are
    denied access (rarely needed ;).  If deny_read is empty or not set, the
    determination of repository access depends on the presence and content of
    the allow_read list (see description).  If both deny_read and allow_read are
    empty or not set, then access is permitted to all users by default.  If the
    repository is being served via hgwebdir, denied users will not be able to
    see it in the list of repositories.  The contents of the deny_read list have
    priority over (are examined before) the contents of the allow_read list.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
